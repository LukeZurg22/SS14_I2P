Small functionality tweak, technically there isnt a need to escape the color tags, no need for [/color] marks at all.
Allowed me to squeeze more text into the otherwise finnicky limits

Hmnn.. you just assign the new color instead
so you'd just- infact I've done it for the CC notes

Basically color tags dont need ending tags, but putting an ending tag later breaks it. So an option to
shorten the document input at the cost of being unable to accurately control text color will be needed.


-----------------------------------------POSSIBLE UI ADDITION
I may be able to implement additional text witchcraft with CSS and whatnot,
but thats something a bit extreme for now.
-----------------------------------------COLOR LIMITATIONS
You can have any color out of 0,0,0,0 to 255,255,255,255, so a a byte^4's worth of free choices.
But SS14 only seems to cope with so many different-colored squares at a time. Too many tags means too much of the document is filled.
Printing the .txt document circumvents most of the text limit!
The large files you send still prints, but is cut off by the paper, which may change size.

-----------------------------------------WARNING ABOUT SIZE
UI scales at 75% and 200% while extreme, will add a significant reduction of
-3 and -2 pixel max on standard paper respectively while also adding vertical whitespace between chars.
While 100-125-150% dont have vertical whitespace but do have a reduction of 0-0-0.5 respectively
-----------------------------------------TO MAKE ADDITIONS WITH
I'll make a nice box + a button for easy copy and paste though
So a text file wont even be needed.
BUT I could still make it savable to a text file, just in case one wanted to save it for later, or for printing.
